# bikesharing

## Project Overview
### Purpose
I've been asked to utilize Tableau to create visualizations that we can present to investors in order to show them that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. I completed the analysis using August Citi Bike data from New York City in order to get a better understanding of what a bike-sharing program in Des Moines might look like.

## Results

![Top starting locations](https://github.com/secicciari/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/top_starting_locations.PNG)
The top starting locations appear to be in areas that are heavily populated with tourists.

![Gender breakdown](https://github.com/secicciari/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/gender_breakdown.PNG)
Male riders make up almost 75% of Citbike users. 

![Checkout times for users](https://github.com/secicciari/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/checkout_times_for_users.PNG)
All of the Citibike trips in our analysis last less than 60 minutes, with most lasting around 10 minutes.

![Checkout times by gender](https://github.com/secicciari/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/checkout_times_by_gender.PNG)
Across genders, the trip duration appears relatively consistent. Female users may be more likely than male users to use a bike for longer than 20 minutes.

![Trips by gender by weekday](https://github.com/secicciari/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/trips_by_gender_by_weekday.PNG)
Male subscribers make up the majority of Citibike users in our analysis. Thursday is the most popular day for subscribers to rent a bike, followed by Friday, then Tuesday and Monday.

Thursday evenings are the most popular times for both male and female users.

![Trips by weekday per hour](https://github.com/secicciari/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/trips_by_weekday_per_hour.PNG)
During the week, the most popular times for starting bike rentals are druing the morning commute from about 7AM to 10AM, and during the evening commute from about 5PM to 8PM. On Saturday and Sunday, bike usage appears to be more consistent throughout the day.

## Summary
Overall, the data shows that, at least in New York City, bike sharing tends to be most popular in areas with a lot of people (such as tourist destinations and business districts) and during heavy commute times, especially on Thursdays. It also appears to be more common among men. If Des Moines moves forward with a bike sharing program, I would recommend focusing first on the more populated areas of the city near office buildings and popular tourist spots.
It's important to note that Des Moines likely has a smaller tourist population than NYC

### Recommendations for Future Analysis
1. Since New York City and Des Moines are so different, I would recommend doing further analysis on the populations in each city to see how the demographics compare.
2. I would also recommend doing an analysis on the infrastructure of each city to further compare the data (i.e., how many streets have bike lanes).
